## 🎯 What To Do RIGHT NOW

### 1️⃣ Deploy Backend (5 minutes)

**Using Railway (Easiest)**

1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Click **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. Select: `Personal_knowledge_assistant`
6. Add **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyBV080dHbuXbmkPZ2Nbi-XZgZCxSy8ohqg
   PORT=3001
   ```
7. Railway will detect `backend/package.json` and deploy
8. **Copy your Railway URL** (looks like: `https://xxxx.up.railway.app`)

### 2️⃣ Configure Vercel (2 minutes)

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add NEW variable:
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://xxxx.up.railway.app/api` (your Railway URL + `/api`)
   - **Environments**: Check all (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Click **Save**

### 3️⃣ Redeploy (1 minute)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure deployment"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy in ~2 minutes.

## ✅ Verification

After deploy completes:

1. Open your Vercel URL
2. Press F12 (open browser console)
3. Upload a document
4. You should see:
   - ✅ No `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors
   - ✅ Requests going to your Railway URL
   - ✅ Documents uploading successfully

---

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### Backend not responding
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in Railway
- Test backend directly: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/health`

### Frontend still trying localhost
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set in Vercel
- Trigger new deployment (push a small change)
- Check deployment logs

### CORS errors
- Already fixed in `backend/src/index.ts`
- Automatically allows all `.vercel.app` domains
- If needed, add your specific domain to `allowedOrigins` array
